# Pathbuilder-SF2EPT-Custom-Pack
  This project is an attempt to bring the Starfinder 2nd Edition (SF2E) Playtest into Pathbuilder via Custom Packs. There are a number of challenges, because while cross-compatibility with Pathfinder 2E (PF2E) is a design goal of SF2E, there are certain aspects that Custom Packs cannot alter, like the skills. However, this project is just intended to aid with character building. It isn't intended to replace your character sheet.

# Limitations
* Computers and Piloting could not be added into Pathbuilder whatsoever. If you wish, you can make Computers into a Lore skill, since it is Int-based, but that won't work for Piloting, which is Dex-based.
* Any feat which grants a cantrip of your choice can't actually grant you one like base Pathbuilder equivalents can.
* The "Ancestry Lore" feats can't automatically fill in the ancestry name.
* The Playtest tends to make all innate spells divine, but you cannot change the spell's tradition when giving it as an innate feat, nor can you rerank it. I'm not sure if the Playtest document meant to add innate spells at different ranks than they appear in Player Core, but some of them are different.

# Scope
  Copying and pasting is a long tedious business, so I will not attempt to bring every class, feat, or spell into the Custom Pack. Here is what I plan on:
1. Ancestries - Finished!
* I have successfully created custom ancestries for every one published in the Playtest document, including heritages and all ancestry feats. I have also reproduced every feat, spell, unarmed attack, and (in the case of one Vesk heritage, natural armor) that is referenced in each feat.
* In an effort to reduce my workload, I did not reproduce feats from existing PF2E ancestries which were repeated in the Playtest (except for the Android, which I did not realize already existed in PF2E until after I had finished.) A quirk of this is that _**you NEED to pick Ratfolk from the Uncommon tab instead of Ysoki,**_ since I could make all Ysoki feats accessible to Ratfolk, but not all Ratfolk feats accessible to Ysoki. I also did not reproduce ratfolk heritages with different names and flavor text if the mechanical effect was the same in the corresponding Ysoki heritage.
* The exception to this is the Android ancestry, which I had already finished before I realized Androids are a PF2E ancestry already.
2. Backgrounds - Not Started
* There weren't THAT many new backgrounds, and backgrounds aren't very complex, so it shouldn't take too long.
3. Classes - Not Started
